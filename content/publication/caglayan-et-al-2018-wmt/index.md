abstract: This paper describes the multimodal Neural Machine Translation systems developed
  by LIUM and CVC for WMT18 Shared Task on Multimodal Translation. This year we propose
  several modifications to our previous multimodal attention architecture in order
  to better integrate convolutional features and refine them using encoder-side information.
  Our final constrained submissions ranked first for English-French and second for
  English-German language pairs among the constrained submissions according to the
  automatic evaluation metric METEOR.
