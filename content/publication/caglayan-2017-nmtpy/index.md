abstract: In this paper, we present nmtpy, a flexible Python toolkit based on Theano
  for training Neural Machine Translation and other neural sequence-to-sequence architectures.
  nmtpy decouples the specification of a network from the training and inference utilities
  to simplify the addition of a new architecture and reduce the amount of boilerplate
  code to be written. nmtpy has been used for LIUM’s top-ranked submissions to WMT
  Multimodal Machine Translation and News Translation tasks in 2016 and 2017.
