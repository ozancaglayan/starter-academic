abstract: 'Computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing,
  running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing results; however, computational
  science lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide their source code as
  a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible.
  But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than
  two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not
  scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and
  data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews.
  Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and
  are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised
  in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational
  research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research,
  promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original
  research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole
  publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals.
  ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study
  is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.'
