abstract: In this study we implemented a low-cost, single EEG channel brain computer
  interface (BCI) running on an embedded computer. The BCI uses steady-state visual
  evoked potentials (SSVEP) to control the motion of the Kondo KHR-3HV humanoid robot.
  The subject attends to one of the flickering LEDs attached to the arms of the robot
  in order to move an arm. SSVEPs are identified by a simple spectrum analysis of
  the EEG signal.
