abstract: The attention mechanism is an important part of the neural machine translation
  (NMT) where it was reported to produce richer source representation compared to
  fixed-length encoding sequence-to-sequence models. Recently, the effectiveness of
  attention has also been explored in the context of image captioning. In this work,
  we assess the feasibility of a multimodal attention mechanism that simultaneously
  focus over an image and its natural language description for generating a description
  in another language. We train several variants of our proposed attention mechanism
  on the Multi30k multilingual image captioning dataset. We show that a dedicated
  attention for each modality achieves up to 1.6 points in BLEU and METEOR compared
  to a textual NMT baseline.
