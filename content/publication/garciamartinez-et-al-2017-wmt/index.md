abstract: This paper describes LIUM submissions to WMT17 News Translation Task for
  English-German, English-Turkish, English-Czech and English-Latvian language pairs.
  We train BPE-based attentive Neural Machine Translation systems with and without
  factored outputs using the open source nmtpy framework. Competitive scores were
  obtained by ensembling various systems and exploiting the availability of target
  monolingual corpora for back-translation. The impact of back-translation quantity
  and quality is also analyzed for English-Turkish where our post-deadline submission
  surpassed the best entry by +1.6 BLEU.
